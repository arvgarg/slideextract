SlideExtract
============

SlideExtract is a simple program to extract slides from videos.
It outputs an image for each slide. Slide detection is done by comparing each
frame with the previous one. For better results and speed it is recommended
to specify a region that should be compared. Best results are usually achived
when selecting the slide number (since that only changes with every slide).

Once extraction is completed you can view the extracted slides with your
favorite image viewer and delete possible duplicates (this usually happens
when the video jumps back and forth between slides).

You can then combine the slides to a pdf with a tool like convert:

    convert `ls -v outprefix*.png` outprefix.pdf
